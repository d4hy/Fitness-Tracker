Hi! My application is a website that works with SQL, CORS, and Express to let you record your reps, weight, and sets for your workouts. You can create entries, edit them, view them, delete them, and track your personal records for the highest weight you’ve lifted for each exercise. The app uses my personal dataset, which I imported as an SQL file. To run it locally, you’ll need to use a service like XAMPP to provide the MySQL database (you won’t need to use Apache, since Express serves the app directly).You just need to change in the back end directory after launching XAMPP, and do npm install and npm start to launch the entry point.
